//May the lord forgive me.
//For I sure as shit won't.
//This handles management of specific offsets, and ensures we can change things around for weird and wacky species things. Like Lizards getting tailbags instead of backpacks (frills hurt when compressed!!!)
//Generally this is very useful to not have to resprite the same item over and over, as you can now instead off-set it on a species/bodypart by bodypart basis.
//A majority of these will be unused until said species are added, and may never be used, but are still good to define for adminbus.
